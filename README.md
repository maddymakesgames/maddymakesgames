# Hi I'm Madeline (she/her)
I'm transfem and I'm currently studying computer science in college.

## Exploits
- Rust
  - First learned in october of 2019
  - Been actively using since

- JS/TS
  - First learned in august of 2016
  - My use of JS has dropped off in recent years as I have learned other langs
  - Used in both Node.js and browser code
  - Most of my notable JS work is private but my [minesweeper clone](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/minesweeper) was my first real web development project
- Java
  - Been using forever
  - I've mostly used it for class work or minecraft related projects
  - No notable examples as the vast majority of my java dev has been class work or private
- C
  - Learned in fall 2021 for college
  - Relatively inexperienced since I prefer using Rust for my personal projects
- WASM
  - Made multiple web apps using Rust by compiling to WASM
  - [graph visualizer](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/graph_visualizer) and [cards for humanity](https://github.com/Cassy343/cards-for-humanity) being the public examples
- OpenGL / Vulkan / WebGPU
  - While I mostly know the WebGPU api (usually using [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/)), I have also worked with Vulkan and OpenGL
  - [OpenGL examples](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/python-graphics) that I made to help teach a friend
  - My [rendering library](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/Petra) wrapping wgpu 
- REST APIs
  - Extensively made use REST APIs both as a consumer and producer
  - Reverse-engineered my highschool's website api to create an alternative interface to look up people in the directory
  - Have done private work developing and mantaining multiple companies' apis, usually utilizing Node.js and typescript 
- Calculator Development
  - Made a [snake clone](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/ce-snake) in EZ80 assmebly
  - Spent too much effort trying to get Rust on the ti-84+ce: [Rust-CE](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/Rust-CE)
- Discord bots
  - Have made countless discord bots written either JS,TS, or Rust
- Minecraft Reasearch
  - Has spent multiple years reading deobfuscated Minecraft code
